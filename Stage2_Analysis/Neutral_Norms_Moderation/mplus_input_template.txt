MODEL:

MODEL CONSTRAINT: 
	
	! Use model constraint subcommand to test simple slopes
	! Pick low, med, and high moderator values
	! e.g., 1 SD above mean, mean, and 1 SD below mean

	NEW(Low_age Med_age High_age Simp_lo Simp_med Simp_hi);

	Low_age = -2.24;
	Med_age = 0;
	High_age = 2.24;

	! Calc simple slopes for each value of age

	Simp_lo = b1 + b3*Low_age;
	Simp_med = b1 + b3*Med_age;
	Simp_hi = b1 + b3*High_age;
